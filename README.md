Expense Tracker Applicaiton:

Applicaiton Sumary: This Applicaiton is based on Tracking Expenses Quickly and Effectivley. Features a Private Wall for login and registration.

Software And Features: The project is MERN based so the entire project is pretty much javascript based from the backend to the frontend. Express and Node server with MongoDB database.
Very Little html in react. wanted to use full javascript for this project, es6, arrow functions as well. Tested Routes with Postman and used localhost3000 for react developement and 
localhost8000 for backend developement and testing.

Usage: Link: http://54.177.75.113 This Link is using this project in production with ec2 aws. due to fact it is just a project to demonstrate simple skills, might still be a little bit buggy. But this application is secure and safe to use and all backend functions are demonstrated properly.
